I'm a [sociology PhD student](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=gaia-ghirardi) at the Department of Political and Social Science at the [European University Institute (EUI)](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) in Florence. I'm also a research fellow at the University of Bologna on the [GENPOP](http://genpop.org) project. 

I am a sociologist with research interests in educational and health inequalities, social stratification, sociogenomics, and early childhood. 

My research aims to understand the *intergenerational transmission* of social inequalities in educational and health outcomes using also genetics data. In my PhD project, I focus on gene-environment interaction (GxE) to understand how genes and the environment interact in shaping social inequality in education and health.
