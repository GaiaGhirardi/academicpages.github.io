Bio
======

Hi, welcome to my page!

 I am a PhD student at the European University Institute in Political and Social Science. My PhD project is about **how genes and environment interact in shaping social inequality in educational attainment.**

 I have a background in **Sociology and quantitative methods.** I obtained my BA in Sociology at the University of Milano Bicocca and a double MA in Sociology between the universities of Trento and Bamberg. During my master, I also worked as a student research assistant at the University of Bamberg and as a tutor for courses on quantitative methods at the Univerisity of Trento.

I am interested in **social stratification and educational inequalities since the very beginning.** In my BA thesis, by using PISA data, I started to investigate whether advantaged students have higher educational performances compared to disadvantaged ones. Then, in my MA thesis, I used the newborn sample of the NEPS data to examine whether formal childcare can be an effective tool to reduce social inequality in childrenâ€™s competencies.  

Please write me, if you work on similar topics or are interested in my work!
