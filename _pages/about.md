Bio
======


 I am a PhD student at the European University Institute in Political and Social Science. My PhD project is about **how genes and environment interact in shaping social inequality in educational attainment.** 

 I have a background in **sociology and quantitative methods.** I obtained my BA in Sociology at the University of Milano Bicocca and a double MA in Sociology between the universities of Trento and Bamberg. 

I am interested in **social stratification and educational inequalities** since the very beginning. I started being obsessed with educational inequalities already during my bachelor and master. In my PhD, I want to go one step further by investingating educational inequalities taking into account also genetics differences.
