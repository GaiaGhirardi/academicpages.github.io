I'm a [sociology PhD student](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=gaia-ghirardi) at the Department of Political and Social Science at the [European University Institute (EUI)](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) in Florence. 

My PhD project is about **how genes and environment interact in shaping social inequality in educational attainment.** 

I am interested in **social stratification and educational inequalities** since the very beginning. I started being obsessed with educational inequalities already during my bachelor's and master's. In my PhD, I want to go one step further by investinging educational inequalities taking into account also for **genetics**.
