I'm a [sociology PhD student](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=gaia-ghirardi) at the Department of Political and Social Science at the [European University Institute (EUI)](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) in Florence. I'm also a researcher at the University of Bologna working on the [GENPOP](http://genpop.org) project led by [Nicola Barban](http://nicolabarban.com). 

I am a sociologist with research interests in educational inequalities, social stratification, sociogenomics, and early childhood. 

My research aims to understand the *intergenerational transmission* of social inequalities in socio-demographic and health outcomes using also genetics data. 

In my PhD project, I focus on gene-environment interaction (GxE) to understand how genes and the environment interact in shaping social inequality in education and health. Using sociological theories and knowledge, my PhD thesis explores educational inequalities incorporating genetic data.
