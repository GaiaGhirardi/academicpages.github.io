I'm a [sociology PhD student](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=gaia-ghirardi) at the Department of Political and Social Science at the [European University Institute (EUI)](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) in Florence. 

I am a sociologist with research interests in educational inequalities, social stratification, early childhood, and sociogenomics. 

In my PhD project, I study **how genes and environment interact in shaping social inequality in educational attainment**. Using decades of sociological theories and knowledge, in my PhD I investigate educational inequalities including **genetics data**. 

My research aims to understand the *reproduction of social inequality* on various socio-demographic and health outcomes. Specifically, I investigate 1) the role of childcare arrangements and parenting in social inequalities in children's competencies, and 2) how family socioeconomic status mediates genetic associations on different outcomes, such as educational attainment.
