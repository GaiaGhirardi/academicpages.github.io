I'm a [sociology PhD student](https://www.eui.eu/people?id=gaia-ghirardi) at the Department of Political and Social Science at the [European University Institute (EUI)](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) in Florence. Now visiting at the UNED, Madrid.  

I am a sociologist with research interests in educational inequalities, social stratification, sociogenomics,and early childhood. 

My research aims to understand the *intergenerational transmission* of social inequalities in socio-demographic and health outcomes. I investigate: 
* The role of parenting and different childcare arrangements on the reproduction of social inequalities, and
* The role of family socioeconomic status in moderating the genetic associations on educational and health outcomes  

In particular, in PhD project, I study how genes and environment interact in shaping social inequality in educational attainment and health outcomes. Using decades of sociological theories and knowledge, in my PhD I investigate educational inequalities including genetics data.
