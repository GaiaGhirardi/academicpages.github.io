## Ghirardi, G. & Bernardi, F. The GxSES interaction for educational attainment: The key role of educational outcome selectivity
<details>

A growing body of research investigates whether the opportunity to realize the genetic endowment for education varies by parents’ socio-economic status (SES). However, theoretical expectations and previous evidence on the moderation of family’s SES on the genetic association on education lead to inconclusive conclusions. We combine behavioural genetics and stratification literature to examine whether this mixed evidence may be due to the selectivity level of the educational outcome analysed and the individuals’ genetic predisposition to education. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), we investigate educational outcomes characterized by different levels of selectivity: high school completion, college enrolment, college completion, graduate school completion and PhD completion. Results show that high-SES parents can be more able to compensate for low genetic endowment when the educational outcome is easier to achieve and boost genetic endowment for the outcome that is more difficult to reach.

The persistent transmission of educational (dis)advantages over generations is well-documented in social stratification research, but we know less about specific mechanisms. Drawing from rational action theories, the compensatory advantage mechanism predicts that negative traits or events for educational achievement—i.e., low birth weight or endowments—are not or little consequential for advantaged children compared with disadvantaged peers. However, with mixed findings, previous evidence on compensatory patterns for early-life unfortunate events or traits is scarce, mainly when applied to genetic endowments for educational attainment. This article tests whether high-SES families compensate for bad luck in the genetic lottery for educational achievement. Using data from a genotyped sample of twins and siblings from the Netherlands Twin Register (NTR), we build polygenic indexes (PGI) for cognitive and non-cognitive skills, and we regress different educational outcomes—grades in primary education (mathematics and reading at age 7 and 10), test scores (CITO), track choice and educational attainment—on both PGS stratifying by parental SES. We combine a between- and within-family design to account for different sources of confounding and test complementary compensatory mechanisms. Preliminary results for the between family analysis show that PGI for cognitive skills is less predictive of test score, track choice, educational attainment for high-SES children by suggesting a compensatory advantaged mechanism in play. Similarly, we find compensation for track choice, educational attainment and boosting for grades in mathematics at age 7. The within family analysis confirms a compensation effect for low PGI for cognitive skills in test score, track choice and grade in mathematics at age 10 and a boosting effect for PGI for non-cognitive skills in reading at age 7

##  Berger, L., Ghirardi, G., Panico L., Solaz, A., The impact of early formal childcare attendance and exposure on children’s developmental outcomes in France

<summary>Read more</summary>
The importance of early childhood education and care (ECEC) for fostering children’s development and reducing early inequalities is widely recognized by previous studies. However, much of this evidence refers to pre-school (i.e., to 3-to 5-year-olds), and mainly stems from randomized evaluations of small-scale intensive programs based in the United States and other English-speaking countries. This study thus examines the impact of ECEC under the age of 3 on children’s development and its role in tackling the early social inequality in such outcomes in France. We ask whether attending ECEC at age 2 has a positive (or negative) impact on children’s developmental outcomes and if the role of ECEC on child development is different according to the family’s socio-economic status (SES). We address these questions, using the Étude Longitudinale Français depuis l’Enfance (Elfe), and ordinary least squares (OLS) models with inverse probability weight (IPW) to account for confounding bias possibly arising from selection into care arrangements. Our findings show that ECEC attendance positively affects children’s development and that disadvantaged children benefit more in children’s global development from attending ECEC. These results suggest that ECEC institutions may be an effective tool to reduce social inequalities in some, but not all, early child developmental outcomes.
